## How to Delete All User Data

All data in TinyTimeTracker is stored **locally on your device** and not on any external servers.
To delete a specific tracker account:

1.  Select the time tracking account you wish to delete.
2.  Click on the context menu (usually three dots) in the top right corner.
3.  Choose the "**Delete Account**" option.
4.  Confirm your decision in the dialog box that appears.

To delete all app data, you can simply uninstall the TinyTimeTracker app from your device.
