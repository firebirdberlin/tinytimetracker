**Terms & Conditions**

By downloading or using the TinyTimeTracker app, you agree to these Terms & Conditions. These terms
complement the GNU General Public License (GPL v3), under which the TinyTimeTracker app is
licensed. Your rights and obligations regarding the copying, modification, and distribution of the
app are governed by the GPL v3. You should review the full text of the GPL v3.

While the app itself is open-source, all my trademarks, copyright (where applicable, e.g., for
documentation or specific assets not covered by GPL v3), database rights, and other intellectual
property rights related to the TinyTimeTracker brand and its original development still belong to
Stefan Fruhner.

Stefan Fruhner is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For
that reason, I reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any
time and for any reason. I will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very
clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

The TinyTimeTracker app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to me, to provide
my Service. This data is stored exclusively on your device. It’s your responsibility to keep your
phone and access to the app secure. I therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your
phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official
operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious
programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the TinyTimeTracker app
won’t work properly or at all.

The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions.

You should be aware that there are certain things that Stefan Fruhner will not take responsibility
for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The
connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but Stefan Fruhner cannot take
responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and
you don’t have any of your data allowance left.

If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the
agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by
your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the
app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such
charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e.
region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
which you’re using the app, please be aware that I assume that you have received permission from the
bill payer for using the app.

Along the same lines, Stefan Fruhner cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app
i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t
turn it on to avail the Service, Stefan Fruhner cannot accept responsibility.

With respect to Stefan Fruhner’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app,
it’s important to bear in mind that although I endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at
all times, I do rely on third parties to provide information to me so that I can make it available
to you. Stefan Fruhner accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a
result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.

At some point, I may wish to update the TinyTimeTracker app. The app is currently available on Android,
and the requirements for the system (and for any additional systems I decide to extend the
availability of the app to) may change. You may need to download updates if you want to continue
using the latest versions of the app. Stefan Fruhner does not promise that I will always update the
app to be relevant to you and/or work with the Android version you have installed on your device.
However, I may offer updates, and I also reserve the right to stop distributing the app at any time
without prior notice. Please remember that your rights to use, copy, modify, and distribute the
TinyTimeTracker software are governed by the GPL v3 and are not affected by my decision to stop
distributing the app.

**Changes to My Terms and Conditions**

I may update my Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and
Conditions on this page.

These terms and conditions are effective as of 2022-11-12
