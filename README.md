## Your Privacy Matters

*   100% Open Source

## Permissions Required & Why

*   **Location (`ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`):** Android requires this permission to read the name (SSID) of your connected Wi-Fi network. Your location is **never** read, tracked, or stored. This permission is used exclusively for the optional Wi-Fi tracking feature.
*   **In-App Purchases (`com.android.vending.BILLING`):** Required to handle optional in-app purchases that support the app's development.

    ```shell
    $ git clone https://github.com/firebirdberlin/tinytimetracker.git
    ```
2.  Open the `android` folder in Android Studio.
3.  Android Studio should automatically sync the project and download the necessary dependencies.
